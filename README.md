# Progeny Engine Documentation

The Progeny Engine is a 2D game engine built with portability in mind.
Since the engine is still young and changes often the documentation may be sparse or innacurate.
If you find that this document is missing something or needs clarification
please open up an issue and we'll try our best to get to it as soon as we can.
