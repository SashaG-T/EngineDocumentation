<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >This documentation is meant to serve as a means to better understand the inner workings of
the Progeny Engine. This documentation may also serve as a means to understand the workings
of the now legacy &#8220;Core Engine&#8221; from which the code and concepts the Progeny Engine is
derived. Any application made with the Progeny Engine can be logically broken up into three
parts: 1) Interface Implementation; 2) Engine Implementation; 3) User Implementation. The
most common part anyone using the engine would be working with would be the third part,
User Implementation; but, for the sake of everyone involved, this documentation will cover all
three. Before we get too into the workings of the engine it could be useful to understand it&#8217;s
history.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001.1"></a>A Little History Lesson</h4>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >Some of the code within the Progeny Engine dates back to late 2014 and possibly even
2013. Concepts and experience were gathered from an older engine created in late
2013 and early 2014. At this time there was no other goal than to create an engine
and learn from it. In around 2015 the code was transfered to another system and
optimize more, by this point the engine was unofficially called the &#8220;Core Engine&#8221;. The
Core Engine had enough functionality for a simple game. A demo titlescreen for an
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
imaginary game called &#8220;Free Runner&#8221; was created using the engine as a prank and
sortly after, for no unrelated cause, it was deemed logical that the development of a
game alongside the engine would help determine flaws in it&#8217;s design; this was the
begining of the game now called &#8220;Generic Jumper&#8221;. Eventually the game moved to
source version control and for the lack of a more interesting name &#8220;Core Engine&#8221;
ended up sticking. After the release it was obvious that the engine had many flaws in
design. Some issues with the engine were solved during the development of Generic
Jumper with the use of temporary, unsatisfying, patches. Geneirc Jumper released on
August 31, 2018 and the Core Engine shelved and it&#8217;s derivative born: Progeny Engine
Generation 1. Named in such as a means to describe it&#8217;s evolution from the Core
Engine and that the new engine is meant to tackle issues found in the older engine&#8217;s
design.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>The Rough Details</h3>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >This section of the documentation is to give the reader an idea of what different parts of the
engine do in a vague over simplistic way. It is meant to help someone gain a slight
understanding before they dive neck deep into the more complicated text. It also provides a
means for someone wanting to know if this is the right engine for them to use. If there were any
section in this documentation that would be recommeneded above all others it would probably
be this one as this section will help the reader create a basic understanding of the engine&#8217;s
structure.
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.1"></a>Interface Implementation</h4>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Some naive developers might strafe right into developing an engine for a game with
the main engine code calling methods to an external graphics library. Of course,
there are reasons to why you would like to do that for a project yourself but if you
have no idea what systems your engine will be running on it is a good idea to have
some way to seperate engine logic from system dependent logic (such as media layer
calls).
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.2"></a>Engine Implementation</h4>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >The Engine Implementation in a perfect world would not have to be touched by many
individuals. Most of what will be covered in this documentation will not be on how to write the
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
Engine Implementation (as it is already written and if changed makes the rest of
this documentation absolete) but how the Engine Implementation interacts with the
Interface Implementation and the User Implementation. In a nutshell (perhaps a very
too obvious nutshell) the Egine Implementation is the core implementation of the
engine that defines the behaviours of the classes it presents to be used by the User
Implementation.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.3"></a>User Implementation</h4>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >This is what makes a game different from all the other games. It is the logic behind the game.
Not much else to say here.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70002.4"></a>Game States</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Every game will have at least one class, a &#8216;game state&#8217;, that inherites the GameState class. This
class implements virtual functions that are defined by the GameState class and are called at
various points during the program&#8217;s lifetime. Game states are the logical seperations in the
game&#8217;s logic and so it will be natural to have multiple game states per game. Think of a game
you have played. It will have distinctive seperations in gameplay, perhaps it had a:
titlescreen; save file select screen; cutscenes; and, most probably, some sort of main
interactive state. Game states are not limited to these examples but can consist of
loading screens and other non interactive parts of the game; it&#8217;s really up to you!
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Another important thing to note about game states is that they inherit the StateManipulator
class through the GameState class. This give the game states control over the flow between
game states. The GameState class gives the user virtual functions to implement the behaviour
of various points during a game states lifetime where the StateManipulator class gives the user
a way to cause change to the game states lifetime; this will be discussed in more detail in a later
section.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80002.5"></a>Game Objects</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Game Objects are the building blocks of everything the player interacts with. If game states
were the stage of your game then your game objects would be the props, the backdrops, the
curtains, the actors, etc. It is possible to build a game using the engine without the use of the
GameObject class but it would be like re-inventing the wheel when someone already invented
the car! To better exaplain without the use of a super vague analogy: A game object is made up
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
of different smaller parts where each component has some sort of effect on how the player
interacts with it. These smaller parts are called components and they inherite the
ObjectComponent class.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90002.5.1"></a>Object Components</h5>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >There is currently 5 ObjectComponent classes: TransformComponent; SpriteComponent;
RigidBodyComponent; ColliderComponent; and the Controller ObjectComponent class.
The last one is named differently simply because it has a special use and is handled
a bit differently then the rest. If one would want they would be able to add more
ObjectComponent classes but this would require the use of modifying the Enigne
Implementation so that the Engine would know what to do with the newly added component.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   To go over in brief, the TransformComponent represents an object&#8217;s position, rotation, and
an identifyer; the SpriteComponent represents the image (sprite) to use along with
some associated data; the RigidBodyComponent represents the physical properities
the object has such as mass and restitution; the ColliderComponent is the shape of
the object itself; and the Controller ObjectComponent is what defines the object&#8217;s
behaviour (such as how it moves around the screen or what happens when it collides with
some).

<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >If you are using the interface implementations provided by the engine then you will be required
to install a few extra libraries; if not then you will have to build the implementations yourself
(this is not recommend for anyone not familiar with the engine). How to implement the
interfaces will not be discussed here; information on doing so can be found in &#8220;A Guide to the
Not-So-Basics&#8221; section.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-190003.2"></a>Where to Continue</h4>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >This subsection builds off of the previous subsections code although you really only
will need a basic project setup. We will first start off with designing and managing
GameObjects.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-200003.2.1"></a>Designing GameObjects</h5>
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >GameObjects are designed to take advantage of C++&#8217;s polymorphism features. This is to allow
the reuse of code for different GameObjects. An example of this could be to have all
GameObjects that have an animated sprite inherit their main implementation from another
GameObject that implements the animated feature. It is also important to know just how
GameObjects are processed by the engine to make full use of them. First we will create a new
header file named &#8220;mob.h&#8221;. In this header we will include &#8220;src/engine/GameObject.h&#8221; and
define class named &#8220;Mob&#8221; that will inherit the class &#8220;GameObject&#8221; publicly. The source should
look like this:
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-210003.2.2"></a>Behaviour with Controllers</h5>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Instead of adding changes in a GameObject&#8217;s data through GameState functions you can do so
through Controllers.

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-230003.2.4"></a>Events and User Input</h5>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >go over enums and static classes that call EventInterface::pushEvent(..) so that implementation
of the data pointers can be transparent to users. This is important for larger projects with
multiple maintainers as forces the implementation to be in one class. For example if one of the
pointers is dynamically allocated then having a user do eventInterface.pushEvent(..., new
DataObject(), ...) feels unsafe because they&#8217;re passing ownership to something that might feel
unknown. So defining functions that push events in the same class(namespace) means that the
new and delete will be in the same namespace aswell... and the users can simply call
Mob::pushJumpEvent(); to push a jump event. (This can be seen in Walkway for the dialogue
system since it&#8217;s passing pointers to std::string&#8217;s.)
